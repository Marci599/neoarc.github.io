# Privacy & Security - Mario Multiverse

Before joining the beta, here’s what you need to know about how we handle your information and protect the game.

## Why the Beta Is Closed
- Nintendo often shuts down fan games, so we keep the beta private.  
- Our servers have limited bandwidth—too many players at once would make the game unplayable.

## What We Collect
When you play, we collect:
- Email, IP, MAC address, PC name  
- Your Discord ID and username  

We only use this to manage the beta and keep things fair. We don’t keep it permanently unless needed for security.

## Watermarking & Leak Tracing
Leaking happens only when a beta tester shares the game.  
To prevent this, the game adds your Discord ID and username into certain files during updates.  
If the game is leaked, we can see which account it came from.  
If you try to remove this, the game won’t run and the attempt will be logged.

## Anticheat
Cheating ruins the ranking system, so we check if protected values like score and lives are changed.  
We don’t scan other programs on your computer. If cheating is detected, your account will be blocked.

## Encrypted Files
Some files are encrypted so they can’t be tampered with:
- Stages from other players (so no spoilers)  
- Theme settings (to keep gameplay consistent)  
- Cache files for display names and avatars

## File Checks
The game sometimes checks its own files to:
- See if anything has been changed without permission  
- Download only the files you need for updates

## Removing Your Data
If you want your info deleted from our servers, DM **@neoarc** or beta staff on Discord.
