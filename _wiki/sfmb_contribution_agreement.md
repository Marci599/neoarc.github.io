# SFMB Contribution Agreement

Last updated: 14/7/2025

This agreement is required to prevent mass and/or malicious removal of assets that have the potential to delay development or damage the enjoyability of the game by the playerbase.

By contributing assets (sprites, music. etc) to the game, you accept that:

- **You allow the developer and the staff team to use the provided assets for purposes of the game (distributing as theme, showcase videos, etc)**

  - This is a standard clause only for clarification, but nothing original you provide will be stripped of its credit; whenever applicable best efforts to credit you will be done and no credit will be taken for Staff or Dev on assets that were not made by Staff or Dev.

  - You retain the rights to anything you make.

- **Once assets are accepted into an official theme, they will remain in the game until they are replaced by somebody else.**

  - If you added the assets yourself, you can remove them yourself.

  - If you have made significant effort and progress in the entirety of a theme, and you are the owner/manager of the theme, you can request its exclusion from the game. The theme will be marked as “Removed by creator.” The theme may not be redownloaded *within the game*.

    - Sometimes this will happen by community consensus. When this happens, the theme will be “removed by demand”, but may be redownloaded.

  - If you are expelled from beta testing *(note: kicked or banned)*, the assets will also remain until replaced by somebody else.

  - Malicious removals are subject to judgement and are bannable offenses.

  - Your beta testing status may be revoked depending on the reason for your removal.

  - Staff is not obligated to carry out reversions themselves.

- **If you wish to disassociate from the game, you may request credit removal, but asset removal is governed by the point above.**

  - If you decide to leave beta testing on your own but are unwilling to remove your sprites by yourself, they will remain in the game until they’re replaced by somebody else.

  - You can leave beta testing without disassociation at any point and nothing will be affected and such will be honored, but losing beta access means losing access to the Committer tools and such, so you may need to get somebody else to replace your assets if you were to want that.

- **Your credits will remain in the game unless specifically asked to be removed, and the credits will be taken from Resource Committer logs, so as to include everybody in an easy to track way.**

  - There’s a chance that other users can be listed in the *credits.txt/credits.png* file for a theme. This list is not strictly managed by us, but the people working on the theme, although it can be taken as a point of reference for work credits as well.
