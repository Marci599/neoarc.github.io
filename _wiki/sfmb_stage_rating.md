- 5 : Good enough
- 6 : Good enough but more
- 7 : BEST level design and FUN

# Detail meaning and guide

- 0 : Corresponds to the stage that should not be uploaded. This is always a crash, a stage for personal testing, or a stage that slanders someone.
- 1 : This is a stage that is playable, but has no existence value at all. However, personal preference should not be reflected in this evaluation. For example, you should not give 1 point for a level that is too short or a level that is too long. If it is judged that everyone in the world cannot feel this level as a game, such as randomly created randomly or there is only goal point, it is evaluated as 1 point.
- 2 : Although it is in the form of a typical Mario level or other platformer level, a level that only the person who created the level would have fun with, such as providing a lot of unnecessary power-ups or introducing enemy characters, is evaluated with 2 points.
- 3 : If the design is not inferior, but the level is not interesting and you want to finish before the goal, 3 points is appropriate.
- 4 : A normal level that is neither particularly interesting nor uninteresting is evaluated as 4 points.
- 5 : If you enjoyed this stage and you do not feel any dissatisfaction even if you play it again someday, then 5 is appropriate.
- 6 : This stage is great in both design and fun, so I want to play it several more times, but if you feel dissatisfied with some parts, rate it with 6 points.
- 7 : If you think this stage is one of the best stages, give it 7 points. Assuming you are a YouTuber or Twitch streamer, this is the level you want to introduce to other people.
