# Privacy Policy - Mario Multiverse

Before you play this game, you must read and agree to this Privacy Policy.  
This document explains what information is collected, how it is used, and the measures taken to protect the game and its assets.

## 1. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years of age, or the minimum legal age required in your jurisdiction, or have consent from a legal guardian to participate in the beta test.  
If it is determined that you are under this age without consent, beta access will be revoked.

## 2. Information Collected

- Email Address  
- IP Address  
- MAC Address  
- PC Name  
- Discord ID, username, and tag (e.g., "neoarc")  

**Purpose:** This information is collected solely for moderation, identification, and beta access management purposes.  
The information is not stored permanently, except where necessary for security logs or enforcement actions.

## 3. Background â€“ Reason for a Closed Beta

Fan games face a high risk of takedown (e.g., DMCA requests from Nintendo).  
To protect the game from premature public exposure and to manage limited server bandwidth, access is restricted to trusted beta testers.

## 4. Restrictions

(A) Nintendo or any party acting on its behalf must not access this game.  
(B) Network bandwidth is limited; additional unauthorized usage could make the game unplayable for all testers.

## 5. Digital Watermarking and Leak Tracing System

**Purpose:** To prevent unauthorized redistribution and to identify the source of leaked game files.  

**How it works:**  
- During game updates, your unique identification (e.g., Discord ID, username) is embedded into certain game files.  
- If these files are uploaded or shared without authorization, the embedded data will identify the account responsible.  
- Altering or removing this data will cause the game to stop functioning, and such attempts are logged on the server for audit purposes.  
- This information is never made public and is only used internally for enforcement.

## 6. Memory Modulation Protection (Anticheat)

The game prevents manipulation of protected in-game values (e.g., score, life counter).  
Detection is based on verifying data integrity, not by scanning unrelated programs or processes.  
Accounts found to be cheating will be blocked from online play.

## 7. Data Encryption

Certain files are encrypted to ensure fair gameplay and prevent tampering:
- **StageWorld files** from other users (to prevent spoilers and route reveals)  
- **ThemeSettings files** (to prevent gameplay differences caused by modified settings)  
- **Cache files** containing display names and avatar information (to prevent unauthorized customization)

## 8. File Scanning

The game may scan its own installation folder and subfolders to:
- Detect unauthorized file modifications  
- Optimize updates by downloading only changed files

## 9. GDPR and Data Deletion

You may request deletion of your stored data at any time.  
Requests should be sent via Discord DM to **@neoarc** or to beta staff.  
Data deletion requests will be processed within the time frame required by applicable regulations.
