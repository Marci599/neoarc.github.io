# Privacy Policy - Mario Multiverse

Before you play this game, you have to trust me and this game.  
I will help you understand what information this game acquires and manages, and for what purpose.

## Background - Understanding the Closed Beta Test

As some of you know, there is a big risk of fan games that most of you don't understand.  
First of all, Nintendo does not usually allow fan games, and when fan games are released, many times, somehow, they shut down the site, stopping game development (DMCA).

Which means I must either get a formal permit from Nintendo or defend against Nintendo so they stop shutting down the game (impossible).
So the best option for that is the Closed Beta Test.

For your information, I tried to inform Nintendo of the game, but there was no public email address for Nintendo. I eventually failed to reach them.

## Restrictions
(A) Nintendo should not approach this game.  
Therefore, not everyone who is not special should approach this game.

(B) The game's network bandwidth is limited, and it is currently being used close to its maximum.  
Therefore, if anyone runs this game and more traffic is used, none of you will be able to play it.

On the premise of these two, I must make sure that you are a trusted user.  
Of course, you can't confirm. You know, there's a lot of beta-testers that leak the game. It's their fault.

It is assumed that you are 13 years old or older, or have a guardian approving of the collection of your data necessary for you to play the game and/or participate in the beta test. If it is known that you are under such age, you may be revoked beta access.

## What information is collected?

(A) Information collected when you sign up for beta testing.

(\*) = Required

*   Email (\*)
*   Name (may or may not be real name) (\*)
*   Age (\*)
*   Discord **username** (e.g. "neoarc")
*   The country you live in (not specific location).

(B) Information that is collected when you play a game

*   IP Address
*   MAC Address
*   Name of the PC
*   Discord ID, name, tag (e.g. "neoarc" (Username, _NOT to be confused with Discord **token**._))

This information is ONLY used for moderation and identification purposes within the game, and it is not used for anything else besides that. The information is not stored persistently.

## Registration Ticket

When you play this game for the first time, you receive a "ticket".  
This ticket is based on your PC and IP. Most of you may have experienced new tickets being issued after formatting your PC.  
This ticket serves to prevent unspecified people from accessing the game if you take the game (Through leaks, and etc).  
Also, when you lose your game account, it becomes a link to restore it.

## DRM (Digital Rights Management)

The item you are most confused about is the DRM.  
Some of you may already know that the older versions of the game (5.8, for example) have been leaked.  
There have already been many leak events, and every time there's an incident, I lose the motivation to develop this game.  
It consumes the game server's bandwidth and makes it impossible for other people to play.

Leaks cannot be initiated from an external user. In other words, the culprit is a beta tester.  
Even then, I don't know who did it.

DRM's role starts here.

## Role of the DRM

DRM is designed to catch criminals through a leaky game file if you take a game with a bad intention.  
That means, it is intended to prevent leakage and protect both the game and the assets contributed.  
It does nothing else.

## How this DRM works

You may know that the game starts with the minimal package and is updated automatically afterwards.  
When the game is updated, it records your information (Discord ID, username, etc) in the game files.  
So if you upload the file to the Internet, it will be known that you uploaded it.

This is not intended to be traceable, and the game will not play if you find out and remove this information.  
However, if you try to do so, a log about it is recorded on the server for audit purposes.

## Memory Modulation Protection (MMP / Anticheat) technology

This game forbids cheating. That is, through a program like Cheat Engine, you get a power-up or another unearned advantage.  
It is forbidden to increase one's life or score.  
If you try, your game account will be blocked from playing.

There is a misunderstanding about how to check if you have cheated.  
The game doesn't scan your programs looking for other processes like Cheat Engine.  
I have developed a technology to detect if games are tampered with values that need to be protected directly (like Score, Life Counter, etc).

The method is simple: keep the values you want to protect in various forms and compare them every time.  
The technical details are omitted because many of you aren't programmers.

Actually, it doesn't matter if you cheat in the game by itself. However, to maintain the ranking system fair for everyone, everyone has to play fair.

## Encryption of data

Some files in the game are encrypted.  
The purpose of encryption is the same. Fairplay.

Encryption happens in:  
(A) Another person's StageWorld stage file download

*   To prevent a trap/cheese/other route from being identified by opening the file with MapEditor.

(B) ThemeSettings file

*   If the setting of the theme is changed, the result may be different even if the same play is played. In other words, some may use Luigi and others may not. It is encrypted to prevent this.

(C) Cache Files

*   Cache files play a role in preventing game servers from wasting bandwidth. This includes the names of users (just the name displayed in the game) and avatar information. Avatar is currently only available to some users as a reward. Cache files are being encrypted to prevent tampering with this. (Of course, even if you tamper with it, it will only appear as modulated information on your pc.)

## Scanning your disk

Game sometimes scans your game folder and its sub-folders.

Game scans your files for two purposes.  
(A) To determine if a file that should not be tampered with has been modified  
(B) To update a game with minimal download, compare the files you have to the latest version.

## GDPR and deletion of data

To comply with GDPR regulations regarding data deletion, deleting your information from the game servers is possible.  
To ask for the (permanent) deletion of your files in the game's server, DM neoarc (@neoarc) in Discord. If not possible, contact beta staff.
